JSON Query Expression Tests
===========================

This test suite is used to test the ActiveData logic. Hopefully
The eventual plan is to split the `pyLibrary.queries` modules into a separate
library, but only once another datasource is given the JSON Expressions API,
and these tests pass. For example, there is already some limited ability to
query memory (aka Python objects), but the API is not tested with this suite,
and certainly not fast. Other useful datastores can use Numpy or a traditional database.
